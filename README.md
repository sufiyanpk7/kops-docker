# kops-docker
##  Image for manage KOPS in docker 
##
We can manage kops without directing to our system.
All we need to do is just put the image into a container in docker.
Moreover all persistent datas like AWS, SSH and kops credentials can be mounted to the desired path.

### You can pull images by 
``` 
docker pull sufiyanpk/kops-docker
```
### You can run images by 
```
docker run -it -d docker.io/sufiyanpk/kops-docker:beta /bin/bash
```
## volume mount paths
```
 - /home/ubuntu/kops 
 - /root/.ssh 
 - /root/.aws
 - /root/.kube
```
